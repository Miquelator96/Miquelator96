Hi, Iâ€™m Miquel Sans, Multimedia Engineer and Graduate student at WPI. 

-I specialize in C#, C++ and Unreal Blueprints, but I have experience in Python, Java, C, etc.
-I have previously worked as a Gameplay Programmer, Game Developer and Game Designer.
-I am looking for challenging work to build on my experience of my two already published titles. I excel at coming up with engaging and viable solutions to create fun player experiences, as well as implementing them.
